# Convolutional-neural-network-for-Mango-Fruit
 This script employs TensorFlow/Keras to train a CNN for mango leaf disease classification. It preprocesses data, builds and trains the model, saves it, and evaluates accuracy. The code also predicts disease presence on an individual image, loading the model from a file and displaying the outcome.
